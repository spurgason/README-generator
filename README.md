  ## Installation
  Users must have Node.js to run and need to install the inquirer npm module to run this application. 

  ## Usage
  After installation users can run the application in the command line by typing “node index” to initialize the application. The application will then prompt the users with questions about their project so they can fill out the README.md file.
